        <h1 class="story-title">Writing Blogs</h1>
        <p class="story-text">Since I was inspired by alot of people like aaron swartz, Richard stallman and many more i understood one thing that its our responsibility to give back to the community or provide your learnings to everyone. So i Started Writing Blogs just to share the information i am good at. I have just started with it so have to go way more in writing blogs But yeah have delivered some which you could read.</p>
        <p class="story-text">I have taken 2 platforms where i write blogs which are medium and dev.to where i try my best to reach maximum people i could. Also Writing Blogs kinda increase my abilty to document y learnings i suggest one should definately devote his time in this as Documenting is a great skill to learn.</p>
